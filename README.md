## UI/UX Research *(The Final Paper is under Research directory)*
For this project, I did a series of different research methods to make an social media application for directed towards songwriters to discover each other and promote collaboration online.

I performed those methods in the following order: 
1. Project Proposal
2. User Interviews
3. Lo-Fidelity Prototype Usability Tests
4. High-Fidelity Prototye Usability Tests

*(Individual write-ups on these research methods are found under the Research directory)*

Through the research, I believe it has made for a better product overall. Having user input for a product built for THEM makes the project even more special.

## Steps to run the High-Fidelity prototype locally
1. Clone this repo into your local machine
2. Make sure you have node.js downloaded
   - This is done in React.js and React requires Node.js for it to run.
   - Download can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. Open your terminal/command prompt in the same location where you cloned the repo and do the following commands
   - `npm install`
   - `npm install react-icons --save`
   - `npm install reactjs-popup --save`
4. Finally to view the project enter `npm start` in the terminal. The project will be hosted on localhost:3000
